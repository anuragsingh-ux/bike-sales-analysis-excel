# Bike Sales Dashboard & Analysis (Excel)

## 📊 Project Overview
This project showcases end-to-end data analysis and dashboarding using **Microsoft Excel**.

## 🗂️ Project Files
- `Excel-Bike-Sales-Analysis-Anurag.xlsx`: Contains the cleaned data, pivot tables, and final dashboard.
- `README.md`: Project documentation (this file).

## 🧹 Data Cleaning
Performed essential cleaning and transformation to make the raw data analysis-ready:
- Removed duplicate records.
- Standardized inconsistent values (e.g., "M" ➝ "Male").
- Created **Age Brackets** using nested `IF` formulas (`Young`, `Middle Age`, `Old`).
- Ensured columns like `Gender`, `Marital Status`, and `Occupation` were uniformly formatted.

## 📈 Data Analysis
Utilized Excel’s analytical tools to summarize key insights:
- Built **Pivot Tables** to calculate:
  - Average income based on gender and purchase status
  - Bike purchase trends across different regions
  - Customer distribution by age group, commute distance, and number of children
- Created summary views of key business questions.

## 📊 Data Visualization & Dashboard
Developed a fully interactive dashboard using:
- **Pivot Charts** for visual representation of income, age, gender, and purchase behavior
- **Slicers** for dynamic filtering by region, age bracket, and gender
- Used conditional formatting and data labels for improved clarity

Dashboard allows users to interact and explore data across multiple dimensions.
